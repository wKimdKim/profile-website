          Hello! My name is Woo Sang (Derek) Kim. I am a Korean Kiwi based in
          Auckland, New Zealand. I am also a University of Auckland graduate
          with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Information
          System. I aspire to be a software developer because a lot of our
          modern problems can be solved through technology. It is exciting to
          think that the work I will do in the future as a software developer
          will positively impact people by simplifying their lifestyle and thus
          increasing their efficiency.
        </p>

          In my spare time, I like to relieve stress by hanging out with
          friends, hiking and playing pool. Photography is another small hobby I
          have. I enjoy taking photos with film cameras because of the
          anticipation of how the photos will come out. And, I am quite
          passionate about technology in general. I like to tinker with new
          technologies and build up on my knowledge for future use.
        </p>

          I have participated in many hackathons and have my own personal
          projects. If you are interested then check out my Github account
          listed in my resume.
